# Student-Database-Management-System
I created this Database system using C++ framework

The Student Database Management System is a robust and efficient application designed to streamline the management of student records. This project offers a user-friendly interface for administrators to add, search, update, and delete student information. The system ensures data integrity and security by implementing authentication mechanisms and role-based access control.

>Launch the SDMS.exe file directly to use the app.

>For admin access, the ID and Password are - "admin" and "pass" respectively.

>Admin can add, search, update, view and delete the details of the student.

>Student can only view the details.
